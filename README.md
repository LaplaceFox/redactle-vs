# Redactle

A game inspired by https://www.redactle.com/ built in svelte. This is a work in progress; Content is currently hardcoded to one article. My motivation for starting this is to do away with the 1 game per day limit that redactle.com enforces.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
